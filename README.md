# SQL_Portfolio
## Description
Hi everyone, my name is Prateek Pal.
This is my first SQL portfolio project in which I have taken a dataset from [Kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harsha547/indian-premier-league-csv-dataset?select=Ball_by_Ball.csv) 
This dataset includes IPL 2008-2016 data with 6 inter-connected tables :
1. Ball_by_Ball.csv
2. Match.csv
3. Player.csv
4. Player_Match.csv
5. Season.csv
6. Team.csv
I have also provided the Schema image to understand the relationship and inter-connectedness within the tables.
And in the portfolio.sql file, I have written the data analysis queries.
